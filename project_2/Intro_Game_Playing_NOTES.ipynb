    "Playing strategy **(deterministic)**games like checkers or isolation or chess, we can use the same algorithms, even the same code to make a computer player for a game  that's as simple as tic-tac-toe or as comlex as chess.\n",

    "In principle the only thing that is diffrent between these games is the code for generating all teh next possible moves as well as the user interface.\n",

    "- **MiniMax** is our primary algorithm to figure aout the best move at every turn.\n",
    "- **Alpha-beta pruning**: helps optimize this algorithm, making the agent play quicker.\n",
    "- **Expectimax**: modified version of Minimax for change games that considers all the possible outcomes and chooses the one with the maximun expected return, That is assuming the opponent is making the best moves available.\n"
